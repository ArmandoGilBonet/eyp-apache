#   Configure the SSL Session Cache.

# Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG):
# Configure one or more sources to seed the PRNG of the SSL library.
# The seed data should be of good random quality.
# WARNING! On some platforms /dev/random blocks if not enough entropy
# is available. Those platforms usually also provide a non-blocking
# device, /dev/urandom, which may be used instead.
#
# This does not support seeding the RNG with each connection.
#
# examples:
# NSSRandomSeed startup builtin
# NSSRandomSeed startup file:/dev/random  512
# NSSRandomSeed startup file:/dev/urandom 512
